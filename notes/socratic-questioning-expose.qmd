## Introduction: The promise of the digital Socrates

The integration of large language models into educational technology has revived long-standing enthusiasm for Socratic tutoring: the ancient pedagogical method of guiding learners toward understanding through strategic questioning rather than direct instruction. Proponents suggest that AI chatbots can now deliver personalized, one-on-one Socratic dialogue at scale, democratizing access to the kind of individualized instruction once available only to the privileged few with access to expert human tutors.

This enthusiasm is understandable. The "two sigma problem" identified by Bloom (1984) demonstrated that students receiving one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in conventional classroom instruction, an effect so large that it would move an average student to the 98th percentile. If AI could approximate even a fraction of this benefit, the implications for educational equity would be profound.

Marketing materials from educational technology companies now routinely invoke Socratic methods, promising that their AI tutors will ask probing questions, guide discovery, and foster deep understanding. Yet a careful examination reveals a substantial gap between these claims and the current evidence base. This exposé examines what cognitive science tells us about why Socratic questioning might work, what the empirical evidence actually shows, and what challenges must be overcome before AI can deliver on these promises.

## The cognitive mechanisms: Why questioning might matter

Before evaluating AI implementations, we must understand the cognitive mechanisms that make Socratic questioning potentially effective. Three interconnected processes are particularly relevant: the generation effect, self-explanation, and the management of cognitive load.

### The generation effect

The generation effect refers to the robust finding that actively generating information produces better retention than passively receiving it [@slameckaGenerationEffect1978]. When a tutor asks a question rather than providing an answer, the learner must retrieve relevant knowledge, construct a response, and articulate their thinking. This effortful processing creates stronger and more accessible memory traces than simply reading or hearing an explanation.

However, the generation effect has important boundary conditions. It is most pronounced when learners possess sufficient prior knowledge to generate meaningful responses. When prerequisite knowledge is absent, generation attempts may produce errors that become encoded alongside correct information, potentially interfering with subsequent learning [@metcalfeLearningErrors2017]. This suggests that effective Socratic tutoring requires accurate diagnosis of learner knowledge states, a challenge we will return to below.

### Self-explanation

Chi and colleagues [-@chiSelfExplanationsHowStudents1989; -@chiElicitingSelfExplanationsImproves1994] demonstrated that learners who explain material to themselves, articulating the reasoning behind problem solutions or connecting new information to prior knowledge, show superior learning outcomes. Socratic questioning can prompt self-explanation by asking learners to justify their reasoning, consider why an approach works, or relate new concepts to familiar ones.

The self-explanation effect appears to operate through multiple mechanisms: identifying gaps in understanding, integrating new information with existing knowledge structures, and making implicit knowledge explicit. Importantly, prompting self-explanation is more effective than simply providing explanations, because the learner must engage in the constructive work of building coherent mental representations [@wylieChiSelfExplanationPrinciple2014].

### Cognitive load considerations

Cognitive load theory [@swellerCognitiveLoadTheory2011] reminds us that working memory capacity is severely limited, and instructional designs must manage the demands placed on this bottleneck. Socratic questioning introduces a paradox: the additional cognitive effort required to generate responses and self-explain may enhance learning through desirable difficulty, but it may also overwhelm learners who lack adequate schemas to support the processing.

Expert human tutors navigate this tension through continuous assessment, adjusting question difficulty and providing scaffolding based on moment-to-moment feedback about learner states. They simplify when cognitive overload threatens and challenge when capacity permits. The question for AI implementation is whether current systems can perform this dynamic calibration.

## The evidence gap: Claims vs. data

Despite the theoretical appeal of Socratic AI tutoring, the empirical evidence remains surprisingly thin. A careful review reveals several concerns about the current state of research.

### What studies actually show

Early intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that incorporated Socratic elements, such as LISP Tutor and later cognitive tutors, did demonstrate learning gains compared to conventional instruction [@andersonCognitiveTutors1995; @vanlehnRelativeEffectivenessHuman2011]. However, these systems operated in highly constrained domains with explicitly programmed knowledge models, quite different from the open-ended dialogue capabilities of modern large language models.

VanLehn's [-@vanlehnRelativeEffectivenessHuman2011] meta-analysis found that human tutoring produced an effect size of approximately 0.79 standard deviations compared to classroom instruction, notably smaller than Bloom's earlier estimate and suggesting that much of the "two sigma" effect may have reflected methodological artifacts or Hawthorne effects. Intelligent tutoring systems achieved effects around 0.76, surprisingly close to human tutors, but the comparison conditions and outcome measures varied substantially across studies.

More recent studies specifically examining LLM-based Socratic tutoring are scarce and methodologically limited. Many rely on user satisfaction surveys rather than learning outcomes, compare AI tutoring to no tutoring rather than alternative instructional methods, or assess performance immediately after instruction without examining retention or transfer. The published literature shows clear signs of publication bias, with negative or null results presumably languishing in file drawers.

### Questionable research practices in EdTech research

Several red flags warrant attention. Studies funded by educational technology companies rarely report null findings. Effect sizes often cluster suspiciously close to statistical significance thresholds. Sample sizes are frequently underpowered for detecting the modest effects that educational interventions typically produce. And the enthusiasm gap between press releases and peer-reviewed findings is substantial.

The replication crisis has been slower to reach educational technology research than fields like social psychology, but there is little reason to believe the underlying problems (HARKing, p-hacking, and selective reporting) are less prevalent. Researchers evaluating claims about AI tutoring should demand pre-registration, adequately powered samples, and independent replication before accepting strong conclusions.

## Key challenges for AI implementation

Even granting optimistic assumptions about the underlying mechanisms, AI implementation of Socratic tutoring faces several formidable challenges.

### The diagnosis problem

Effective Socratic questioning requires accurate assessment of what the learner currently understands and where misconceptions reside. Human tutors accomplish this through years of experience with common error patterns, real-time interpretation of verbal and nonverbal cues, and iterative hypothesis testing. Current AI systems lack access to most of these signals and must infer learner states from text alone.

This diagnosis problem is particularly acute because the same incorrect answer can arise from different underlying misconceptions, each requiring different remediation. A student who incorrectly answers that 1/2 + 1/3 = 2/5 might be adding numerators and denominators (a procedural error), might not understand what fractions represent (a conceptual error), or might have made a careless slip. The appropriate Socratic response differs dramatically across these cases.

Large language models can generate plausible diagnostic hypotheses, but their accuracy in distinguishing between alternative misconceptions remains largely untested. Without accurate diagnosis, questioning may be misaligned with learner needs: too challenging when foundational gaps exist, too elementary when the learner is ready to advance.

### Questioning sequence and contingency

Socratic dialogue is not simply asking questions; it is asking the right questions in the right order, contingent on learner responses. Collins and Stevens [-@collinsGoalsStrategiesInquiry1982] identified numerous questioning strategies used by expert Socratic tutors: systematically varying cases, testing hypotheses, probing for deeper justification, and introducing counterexamples. The sequencing of these moves is highly responsive to the trajectory of the dialogue.

Current AI systems can generate individual questions that appear Socratic, but maintaining coherent pedagogical trajectories across extended dialogues remains challenging. The tendency of large language models to be agreeably deferential, accepting learner responses without appropriate challenge, may undermine the productive discomfort that genuine Socratic questioning produces. Conversely, excessive challenge without adequate scaffolding may induce frustration and disengagement.

### Feedback timing and error handling

When learners make errors during Socratic dialogue, tutors face decisions about whether to provide immediate correction, guide the learner toward self-correction through further questioning, or allow productive failure before intervening. Research on feedback timing suggests that the optimal approach depends on learner characteristics, error types, and learning goals: variables that are difficult to assess in real-time AI interactions.

Moreover, the errors that AI systems themselves make (generating incorrect information, misunderstanding learner queries, or providing inconsistent guidance) create additional complications. Learners may encode AI errors as correct information, particularly when the conversational interface lends an air of authority to responses.

## Practical recommendations for educators

Given the current state of evidence, educators evaluating AI tutoring tools should adopt a stance of informed skepticism. The following recommendations may guide decision-making.

**Demand evidence, not testimonials.** Request peer-reviewed studies examining learning outcomes (not just satisfaction), conducted by researchers independent of the company, with adequate sample sizes and appropriate comparison conditions. Be especially wary of studies that compare AI tutoring to no intervention rather than to alternative uses of instructional time.

**Assess diagnostic capabilities.** Effective Socratic tutoring requires accurate understanding of learner knowledge states. Evaluate whether the system can distinguish between different types of errors and adjust its questioning accordingly. Generic Socratic prompts applied without diagnosis are unlikely to outperform simpler interventions.

**Consider opportunity costs.** Time spent with AI tutors is time not spent on other learning activities. Even if AI tutoring produces some benefit, the relevant question is whether it produces more benefit than alternatives available at similar cost. Reading a well-designed textbook, working through practice problems with immediate feedback, or participating in peer discussion might yield comparable or superior outcomes with less technological overhead.

**Start with constrained domains.** The challenges of diagnosis and questioning sequence are more tractable in well-structured domains with clear right and wrong answers. Mathematics and formal logic may be more amenable to AI Socratic tutoring than interpretation-heavy domains like literary analysis or ethical reasoning. Pilot implementations in favorable contexts before broader adoption.

**Monitor for unintended consequences.** AI tutoring systems may inadvertently teach students to game the system rather than genuinely engage with content. They may also undermine the development of self-regulated learning skills if students become dependent on external prompting. Implement monitoring to detect such effects.

## Conclusion

The enthusiasm for Socratic AI tutoring rests on genuine cognitive science insights about the benefits of active generation and self-explanation. These mechanisms are well-established, and there is no reason to doubt that appropriate questioning can enhance learning. The question is whether current AI systems can implement these mechanisms effectively in real educational contexts.

The honest answer is that we do not yet know. The theoretical case is plausible, but the empirical evidence specific to LLM-based Socratic tutoring remains thin and methodologically limited. The challenges of diagnosis, questioning sequence, and feedback timing are substantial, and current systems have not demonstrated mastery of these capabilities.

This is not an argument for dismissing AI tutoring tools entirely. Some may provide value for some learners in some contexts. But educators should resist marketing claims that outpace evidence, maintain appropriate skepticism about extraordinary promises, and insist on rigorous evaluation before committing institutional resources. The goal should be evidence-informed adoption, not technology enthusiasm masquerading as pedagogical innovation.

Socrates himself might appreciate the irony: the best way to evaluate tools that claim to embody his method is to ask probing questions and refuse to accept answers that lack adequate justification.
